        <h3 style="text-align: left; color: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;">Lecture Summary</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">I. AI and Intelligent Systems</p>
        <p style=text-align: left;">AI refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence possessed by humans and animals.</p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Types of Intelligent Systems: <br>• Simple reflex agents: React directly to their environment based on predetermined rules. <br>• Model-based reflex agents: Build internal models of the world to make decisions. <br>• Goal-based agents: Have goals they aim to achieve and plan actions accordingly.<br> • Utility-based agents: Select actions based on their expected utility or value. <br>• Learning agents: Can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. <br>• Social agents: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social setting.</p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Characteristics of Intelligent Systems: Intelligent agents exhibit several key characteristics: <br>• Reactivity: Perceive their environment and respond to changes. <br>• Proactiveness: Take initiative and adapt their behavior to achieve goals. <br>• Socialability: Interact with other agents and their environment in a social context. <br>• Adaptability: Learn and adjust their behavior based on new information and experiences. <br>• Rationality: Make decisions that maximize their chances of success.</p>
                <br>
           <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">II. Data Analysis and Visualization</p>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Data collection is the process of gathering information. Just like collecting different types of toys or stamps, data collection involves bringing together pieces of information from various sources. <br> Data preprocessing is the process of getting your data ready for analysis or machine learning by cleaning, organizing, and formatting it. </p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) a critical process in data analysis, and it serves as the initial step before diving into more indepth analysis or modeling.<br> EDA Methods - In essence, these EDA methods help you get a clear picture of your data, understand how it's spread out, see if there are any interesting connections or surprises, and spot anything that's quite different from the norm. It's like examining and exploring your collection of marbles to learn as much as possible about them.</p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Data Visualization Tools: <br> 1. Matplotlib is like a versatile artist's toolkit for creating all sorts of charts and graphs. It's as if
you have a canvas, and Matplotlib provides you with brushes and colors to paint your data. <br> 2. Seaborn is like a stylist that makes your data look fashionable. It's built on top of Matplotlib and adds some extra beauty and ease to your visualizations. </p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Basic Visualization Types: <br> 1. Line Charts <br> 2. Bar Graphs <br>3. Scatter Plots  </p>
                <br>
         <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">III.Peobability and Statistics</p>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Probability implies 'likelihood' or 'chance'. When an event is certain to happen then the probability of occurrence of that event is 1 and when it is certain that the event cannot happen then the probability of that event is 0. </p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">A random variable is a mathematical concept used to represent uncertain outcomes in probability and statistics. It's a variable that can take on different values with a certain probability associated with each value</p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Types of Probability Distributions:<br> Binomial Distribution: Applicable when there are only two possible outcomes (e.g., success or failure). <br> Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):  Commonly observed in natural phenomena and real-world data. </p>
                <br>
        <p style=text-align: left;">Descriptive Statistics:<br> Mean (Average): It's the sum of all values divided by the number of values. <br> Median: It's the middle value when data is sorted, or the average of the two middle values if there's an even number of values. <br> Variance: It quantifies the spread or dispersion of data points from the mean. <br>Standard Deviation: It's the square root of the variance and measures the average deviation from the mean. </p>
                <br>
